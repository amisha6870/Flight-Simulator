# ✈️ Flight Simulator (OpenGL - C++)

This is a **2D Flight Simulator / City Scene Animation** project built using **C++ and OpenGL (GLUT / FreeGLUT)**.  
It renders a beautiful animated city-style environment with objects like a **sun, road, footpath, houses, trees, electric poles, wires, and a moving vehicle**, using OpenGL primitives.

The project is designed to practice **Computer Graphics concepts** such as transformations, drawing using vertices, and animation using GLUT timer functions.
